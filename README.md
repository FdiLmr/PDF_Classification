# PDF Classification using LLMs, Embedding Models, XGBoost and Linear Regressors

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying a massive dataset of PDFs from the **SafeDocs corpus** using a combination of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **XGBoost**, and other machine learning techniques. The dataset includes over **8.4 million PDFs**, making this a large-scale exploration of both deep learning and traditional machine learning methods.

## Features

- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Leveraged LLMs (Llama-3-70B) for initial label generation from PDF metadata.
- **Embeddings-Based Classification**: Used pretrained embeddings models (e.g., `gte-large`) fine-tuned for specific labels.
- **Tabular Data Techniques**: Applied XGBoost and TF-IDF for lightweight and efficient classification.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualized embeddings and classifications with PCA and UMAP.
